# XRD
Calculates XRD patterns given crystal structure  
Look up atomic scattering factor parameter values for atoms of interest  
Download fractional atomic positions of crystal structure  as csv file  
Adjust lattice parameters and radiation wavelength as needed  
Run Jupiter notebook to calculate and plot XRD pattern
